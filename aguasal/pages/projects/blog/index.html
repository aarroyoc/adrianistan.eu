{% block description %}
<p>Since 2015 I have a blog talking about programming and software, and some offtopic. I write in Spanish and the CMS is custom made, currently called <a href="https://github.com/aarroyoc/diario">Diario</a> made in Rust with Rocket and Diesel.</p>

<p>Some of the code example of the blog are hosted also on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/aarroyoc/blog-ejemplos">https://github.com/aarroyoc/blog-ejemplos</a>.</p>

<p>Previous iterations of the blog run under Blogger, Jekyll and self-hosted WordPress.</p>
